> Last week, Jon Stewart, long-time host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” announced that he would be retiring from the program in 2015 after sixteen years serving as its insightful and irreverent anchor. His news comes on the heels of Stephen Colbert’s exit from “The Colbert Report” in December. Their brand of “fake news” has not only launched the careers of many comedians and satirists, but also has influenced millions of viewers and changed the way many people watch and think about news. In this hour of Radio times, guest SOPHIA MCCLENNEN joins us to discuss her new book Is Satire Saving Our Nation?: Mockery and American Politics and discuss the role that Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and satirical news in general has played in shaping national discourse.
